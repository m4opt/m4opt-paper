\begin{abstract}
\Ac{UVEX} is a wide-field, all-sky, time-domain, ultraviolet survey space telescope selected as a NASA \ac{MIDEX} mission for launch in 2030. \ac{UVEX} will conduct an unprecedented all-sky time-domain survey in two \ac{UV} filters. \ac{UVEX} will follow up \ac{GW} binary neutron star mergers as \acp{ToO}, rapidly scanning across their localization regions to search for their \ac{KN} counterparts. Early-time multiband ultraviolet light curves of \acp{KN} are key to explaining the interplay between jet and ejecta in binary neutron star mergers. Owing to high Galactic extinction in the ultraviolet and \ac{UVEX}'s large \ac{FOV}, variation in sensitivity across the \ac{GW} \acl{ROI} is an important consideration for observation planning. We present an optimal strategy for \ac{GW} follow-up with \ac{UVEX} in which exposure time is adjusted dynamically for each field individual to maximize the overall probability of detection. We have implemented this strategy in an open source astronomical scheduling toolkit called \ac{M4OPT}, on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/m4opt/m4opt}.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

In 2017, \ac{LIGO} and Virgo \citep{2017PhRvL.119p1101A} detected a long-duration \ac{GW} inspiral signal, GW170817, at the same time that Fermi \citep{2017ApJ...848L..14G} and INTEGRAL \citep{2017ApJ...848L..15S} recorded a short \ac{GRB}, GRB170817a. The alert sprang traps that had been set by hundreds of telescopes worldwide \citep{2014ApJS..211....7A,2016ApJ...826L..13A} which quickly found the optical counterpart \citep{2017Sci...358.1556C}, AT2017gfo. As a measure of the degree to which the event focused the efforts of astronomers everywhere, the author list of \citet{2017ApJ...848L..12A} runs to 24 pages!

The scientific harvest from this one event was remarkable. It fulfilled a three-decade-old dream of using \acp{GW} as ``standard sirens'' to measure the Hubble constant \citep{1986Natur.323..310S,2017Natur.551...85A}. Moreover, it proved once and for all the hypotheses that \ac{NS} mergers are the central engines of short \acp{GRB} \citep{2013ApJ...776...18F} and the main cosmic factories of heavy $r$-process elements \citep{1999ApJ...525L.121F}. 

It had long been understood that such mergers would tidally disrupt their \acp{NS}, and that radioactive decay of the heavy elements synthesized in their hot neutron-rich ejecta would fuel transients \citep{1974ApJ...192L.145L,1989Natur.340..126E,1998ApJ...507L..59L} that came to be called \acp{KN}.

In those early days, people assumed that the ejecta would have opacities similar to those in \acp{SN} and predicted fairly bright \ac{KN} light curves that peaked in the optical or \ac{UV} and that would be fairly easy to detect. However, further study of the atomic structure of lanthanides led to the realization that their dense absorption spectra would lead to line-blanketing in the optical, containing the radiation and only letting it leak out much more slowly and at longer wavelengths, in the infrared \citep{2013ApJ...774...25K}. Observers grimly realized that although \acp{KN} were still among the most promising counterparts of \ac{NS} mergers \citep{2012ApJ...746...48M}, they would be much dimmer, redder, and harder to detect than previously expected.

Although these later and more sober predictions agreed remarkably well with the observed spectral sequence of AT2017gfo at times later than a few days \citep{2017Natur.551...67P,2017Natur.551...80K,2017ApJ...851L..21V}, contrary to those expectations it was quite blue and featureless at the earliest observed times, less than a day after the merger \citep{2017Sci...358.1574S}.

In the fallout from GW170817, the cause of this early optical and \ac{UV} emission remains one of the most enduring mysteries. The blue emission could be radioactively powered but result from a geometrically distinct outflow component with higher velocity and/or lower lanthanide fraction \citep{2017ApJ...848L..18N} or could result from the shock caused by the ``cocoon'' interaction between the ejecta and the nascent jet \citep{2017Sci...358.1559K,2018MNRAS.479..588G}. Lacking for GW170817, early-time \ac{UV} observations, less than 12 hours after merger, could handily settle the debate \citep{2018ApJ...855L..23A}.

\subsection{The Coming UV Time Domain Revolution}

More generally, there is a recognized gap in transient discovery capability in the \ac{UV}, and an acknowledged need for space-based \ac{UV} wide-field time-domain survey \citep{2014AJ....147...79S}. To meet this need, some of the authors proposed Dorado (n\'{e}e GUCI, \citealt{2019AAS...23421203C,2023ApJ...944..126D}) to NASA as a \ac{MoO}.

Although NASA made no \ac{MoO} selection in that cycle, shortly thereafter the \citet{2021pdaa.book.....N} recommended in the 2020 decadal survey that ``NASA should establish a time-domain program to realize and sustain the necessary suite of space-based electromagnetic capabilities required to study transient and time-variable phenomena, and to follow up multi-messenger events.'' NASA soon selected a much larger and more capable mission called \acl{UVEX} (\acsu{UVEX}; \citealt{2021arXiv211115608K}; see rendering in Fig.~\ref{fig:render})\footnote{\url{https://www.uvex.caltech.edu}} as the next \ac{MIDEX}.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/UVEXrender}
    \caption{\label{fig:render}A rendering of \ac{UVEX}. Reproduced from the \ac{CSR} and from \citet{2021arXiv211115608K}.}
\end{figure}

\ac{UVEX} will have a wide \ac{FOV} camera that will take images simultaneously in both a \ac{NUV} and a \ac{FUV} band as well as a long-slit spectrograph. The imaging \ac{PSF} diameter of about $\sim$2$\arcsec$ will be well-matched to ground-based follow-up. \ac{UVEX} will perform a mix of surveys with different sky coverage and cadence, and will observe the entire sky to at least $>$25.8~mag over the duration of the prime mission. \ac{UVEX} will not just perform a transformative all-sky time-domain \ac{UV} survey. It will also be able to perform \acp{ToO} to follow up \ac{GW} mergers and other multimessenger phenomena (see Fig.~\ref{fig:uvex-tiling}). With its wide \ac{FOV} and two \ac{UV} bandpasses, it should be able to finally discern the physical mechanism of early-time emission in \acp{KN}.

NASA has also partnered with Israel to provide a launch for ULTRASAT \citep{2024ApJ...964...74S}. ULTRASAT will have an even larger \ac{FOV} than \ac{UVEX} and will be ready to launch a few years before, but with some tradeoffs: it is much less sensitive, has a much larger \ac{PSF}, only a single imaging band, and no spectrograph. Still, \ac{UVEX} and ULTRASAT together will make a potent discovery engine for \ac{UV} transients and general and \ac{GW} counterparts in particular.

\subsection{A Multi-Mission Multi-Messenger Observation Planning Toolkit}

NASA selects Explorer-class missions on the basis of a \acf{CSR} which undergoes several reviews, culminating in an in-person \ac{SV}. In \citet{2025arXiv250114109C}, we elaborated upon the case for \ac{GW} follow-up with \ac{UVEX} more or less as we presented it to NASA in the \ac{CSR}. That \ac{UVEX} study leveraged the same \ac{GW} \ac{ToO} analysis and strategy that we had developed for the Dorado \ac{CSR}. We envisioned our observation planning software, \texttt{dorado-scheduling}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/nasa/dorado-scheduling}}, as an early draft of what would eventually evolve into real ground software and a part of the guest observer toolkit. Therefore, both studies benefited from an unusual level of fidelity and realism for so early in their respective mission lifecycles.

The \texttt{dorado-scheduling} package took into consideration the time-varying \ac{FoR} of the telescope and employs the formalism of \ac{MILP} to find the globally optimal sequence of observations that covers the largest integrated probability within the \ac{GW} localization. Responding to inquiries during the Dorado \ac{SV} about varying extinction and foregrounds, we added to the scheduler a powerful capability to dynamically optimize the exposure time of each field to adjust for spatial variations in sensitivity. Although others have employed exposure time maps to select feasible fields for \ac{ToO} observations \citep{2020A&C....3300425H}, we believe that our adaptive optimization of exposure time by field is novel. In our simulations, this code greatly improved the detection efficiency of the mission. However, this code was not used in the \ac{UVEX} study.

The \texttt{dorado-scheduling} code also had the major limitation that it was released under the obscure and anachronistic \ac{NOSA}, which placed severe obstacles to our own collaborators using or contributing to it. The lawyers at \ac{GSFC} continue to require all \ac{GSFC} scientists to employ \ac{NOSA} even though it has has been rejected by the \citet{FSF}, the \citet{NAP25217}, and even the \citet{SMD}. Fortunately, NASA \ac{HQ} intervened in this case and we were permitted to establish a new, truly open-source, permissively licensed software project, which anyone can contribute to and use. However, this required a rewrite which took several years.

In this paper, we introduce \ac{M4OPT}. It is released under a permissive, mainstream license (BSD), but it has many other advances over the earlier work:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is designed from the start to support multiple missions, including \ac{UVEX} and ULTRASAT. We envision supporting both space- and ground-based observatories in the future.
    \item It can adjust exposure times given the anticipated absolute magnitude and the three-dimensional \ac{GW} localization distribution in sky position and distance.
    \item It can dynamically vary the exposure time of each field to pierce through spatial variations in foregrounds (zodiacal light, Galactic diffuse emission) and dust extinction.
    \item It can be given the anticipated absolute magnitude of the source as either a point estimate or a distribution with Gaussian uncertainty.
    \item The dynamic exposure times are made possible by a \texttt{numpy} \citep{harris2020array} vectorized \ac{ETC} which enables large parameter sweeps of synthetic photometry calculations which are otherwise prohibitively slow with synphot \citep{2018ascl.soft11001S} alone.
    \item It models additional spacecraft dynamics effects, including the roll angle of the telescope which is determined by solar power requirements.
    \item It complies fully with \ac{NPR} 7150 \citep{NPR7150} software engineering practices for ``Class C'' software, and has 97\% test coverage.
    \item It is deeply integrated with the Astropy \citep{2013A&A...558A..33A,2018AJ....156..123A} ecosystem, and has an interface that is based on Astropy coordinates, units, and model classes.
\end{itemize}

In this paper, we describe the mathematical approach of \ac{M4OPT} then use it to produce realistic \ac{ToO} observing sequences with \ac{UVEX} for simulated \ac{GW} events. An example \ac{M4OPT} observing plan is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:example} and Table~\ref{table:example}. We show that the new dynamic exposure time capabilities dramatically increases the probaility of \ac{KN} detection.

\section{Basics of MILP}

\Ac{LP} is a mathematical optimization formalism in which one represents an objective as a linear combination of decision variables, subject to constraints that take the form of a system of linear inequalities. The canonical form a \ac{LP} is
%
\begin{alignat*}{4}
    \text{Find}\quad && &\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^N \\
    \text{that maximizes}\quad && \mathbf{c}^\mathsf{T} &\mathbf{x} \\
    \text{subject to}\quad && \mathbf{A} &\mathbf{x} \leq 0 \\
    \text{and}\quad && &\mathbf{x} \geq 0.
\end{alignat*}
%
\ac{LP} is useful for problems of resource allocation. If instead of being reals, certain of the decision variables are required to be integers, then the problem is called \acf{MILP}. \ac{MILP} allows one to model situations where some decision variables represent alternative courses of action or where some constraints are Boolean in nature. Common applications of \ac{MILP} include planning and scheduling.

\ac{MILP} has already proven useful for astronomical observation planning. \ac{LCO} uses it to allocate observations on a global queue-scheduled network of telescopes \citep{2014SPIE.9149E..0ES}. \ac{ZTF} uses it to multiplex several sky surveys with different coverage and cadence requirements on a single telescope \citep{2019PASP..131f8003B}, and our colleagues have proposed using to schedule \ac{ToO} observations with \ac{ZTF} \citep{2022ApJ...935...87P}. It has been applied to scheduling observing programs on \ac{ALMA} \citep{2016A&C....15...90S} and exoplanet seraches on Keck \citep{2024AJ....167...33H}.

The classic \ac{MWC} has a \ac{MILP} representation that forms the basis of our scheduler. In \ac{MWC}, one has a finite sequence of real-valued weights, $(w_j)_j$ and a finite set of sets, $S = \{S_i\}_i$, over the integers, $\forall i: S_i \subset \mathbb{Z}$. The objective is to find a subset $S^\prime \subseteq S$, with a maximum cardinality $|S^\prime| \leq k$, that maximizes the sum over all of the weights $\sum_{j \in \bigcup S^\prime} w_j$. This is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:max-weighted-coverage}. The \ac{MWC} has a straightforward \ac{MILP} representation:
%
\begin{align*}
\text{Maximize}\quad &\sum_j y_j w_j \\
\text{subject to the constraints}\quad &\sum_i x_i \leq k \\
\text{and}\quad &\sum_{\mathclap{i \mid j \in S_i}} x_i \geq y_j.
\end{align*}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{figures/max-weighted-coverage}
    \caption{\label{fig:max-weighted-coverage}Illustration of \ac{MWC}. Four sets $S = \{S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4\}$ are represented as regions with colored borders. The elements of those sets are represented by black numbered circles.}
\end{figure}

The most basic version of our \ac{ToO} problem is that we want to maximize the total integrated probability that the true, but unknown, position of the source is within one or more of the footprints that we select to observe. Each \ac{GW} alert comes with a localization sky map that gives the posterior probability distribution of the sky position as an image that is sampled on a \acl{HEALPix} (\acsu{HEALPix}; \citealt{2005ApJ...622..759G}) grid. The weights $(w_j)_j$ are the probability values and the subsets $(S_i)_i$ are the \ac{HEALPix} pixels contained within the footprints of the \ac{FOV} on a reference grid of allowed pointings of the telescope (see Fig.~\ref{fig:overlapping-fields}).

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/overlapping-fields}
    \caption{\label{fig:overlapping-fields}\ac{MWC} applied to coverage of an astronomical \ac{ROI} by multiple partially overlapping fields. The centers of \ac{HEALPix} pixels are marked with gray dots.}
\end{figure}

There are a variety of free and open source \ac{MILP} solvers; the most readily available for Python users is HiGHS \citep{huangfu2018parallelizing} which now can be called directly from SciPy \citep{2020NatMe..17..261V}. However, the best commercial \ac{MILP} solvers are much faster and can handle much larger problems than any current open-source software. Although \ac{M4OPT} itself is open source, it calls the commercial \ac{MILP} solver CPLEX\footnote{\url{https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio}} by IBM. CPLEX is free for students, teachers, and researchers, and priced affordably for non-academic use (comparable in cost to mid-range computer-aided design software).

\section{MILP Problem Formulation}

Now we develop an \ac{MILP} formulation of the problem of planning and scheduling \ac{GW} \ac{ToO} obsevations on a large \ac{FOV} telescope. In Section~\ref{sec:fixed-exptime}, we start with a simple but realistic problem in which we require multiple visits of each selected field that must all obey the \ac{FoR} and slew speed limitations of the telescope. In Sections~\ref{sec:variable-exptime} and \ref{sec:absmag-distn}, we add progressively more detail, finally arriving at the full dynamic exposure time problem. All three formulations from Sections~\ref{sec:fixed-exptime}, \ref{sec:variable-exptime}, and \ref{sec:absmag-distn} are implemented in \ac{M4OPT}.

\subsection{Problem 1: Fixed Exposure Time}
\label{sec:fixed-exptime}

We receive a \ac{HEALPix} probability sky map that describes the probability distribution of the true but unknown position of a target of interest as a function of position on the sky. There is a delay between the time that the event occurred and when we can start observations due to the time it takes to uplink commands to the spacecraft, and there is a deadline by which we must complete our observations.

Our telescope can observe any of a set of $n_J$ fields at predetermined sky locations in order to tile the sky map. For each field that we select, our telescope must visit the field at least $n_K$ times. We have a cadence requirement that each visit of a given field must occur at least a time $\gamma$ after the previous visit. Multiple visits with a minimum cadence are essential in short timescale transient searches to rule out moving solar system objects, which otherwise are a major contaminant.

Every visit takes a certain amount of exposure time, and it takes a known amount of time to slew between different fields. We may only a visit a field when it is within the field of regard, the region that constrains where the telescope may point at any given instant of time.

\subsubsection{Data Preparation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Construct a discrete 1D grid of times that stretch from the delayed start of observations up to the deadline.
    \item Propagate the orbit of the spacecraft to calculate the position of the spacecraft at each time step.
    \item For each field and each time step, test whether the field is within the instantaneous field of regard, creating an observability bit map.
    \item Transform the observability bit map into a list of time segments during which each field is observable.
    \item Discard segments shorter than the exposure time.
    \item Discard fields that have no observable segments.
    \item For each field, find the \ac{HEALPix} pixel indices that are within the field's footprint.
    \item Select the 50 fields that contain the greatest probability, summed over the respective \ac{HEALPix} pixels.
    \item Discard pixels that are not contained in any field.
    \item Calculate the slew times between all pairs of distinct fields.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Constraints}

\paragraph{Containment}
Only count pixels that are in one or more selected fields.
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fixed-exptime-constraint-containment}
    \forall i :\quad p_i \leq \sum_{j \in J_i} r_j
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Cadence}
If a field is selected for observation, then enforce a minimum time between visits.
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fixed-exptime-constraint-cadence}
    \forall k > 1 ,\; j :\quad t_{jk} - t_{j,k-1} \geq (\epsilon + \gamma) r_j
\end{equation}

\paragraph{No overlap}
Observations cannot overlap in time; they must be separated by at least the exposure time plus the slew time.
%
\begin{multline}
    \label{eq:fixed-exptime-constraint-no-overlap}
    \forall j^\prime > j,\; k ,\; k^\prime : \\ \left|t_{jk} - t_{j^\prime k^\prime}\right|  \geq \left(\sigma_{jj^\prime} + \epsilon\right) \left( r_j + r_{j^\prime} - 1\right)
\end{multline}

\paragraph{\ac{FoR}}
An observation of a field can only occur while the coordinates of the field are within the \ac{FoR}. For fields that have one observable segment (${n_M}_j = 1$), this constraint is simply an inequality:
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fixed-exptime-constraint-for-one}
    \forall j ,\; k \;, m \mid {n_M}_j = 1 :\quad \alpha_{jm} + \epsilon / 2 \leq t_{jk} \leq \omega_{jm} - \epsilon / 2
\end{equation}
%
For fields that have more than one observable segment (${n_M}_j > 1$), we use the decision variable $s_{jkm}$ to determine which inequality is satisfied:
%
\begin{alignat}{2}
    \label{eq:fixed-exptime-constraint-for-many}
    \forall j ,\; k \;, &m \mid {n_M}_j > 1 : \nonumber \\
    &s_{jkm} = 1 \;\Rightarrow\; \alpha_{jm} + \epsilon / 2 \leq t_{jk} \leq \omega_{jm} - \epsilon / 2 \\
    &\sum_m s_{jkm} \geq 1
\end{alignat}

\subsubsection{Cuts}

\paragraph{Total exposure time}
Although it is implied by other constraints, the constraint that the total exposure time cannot exceed the total available time is found to speed up the search. We add it as a cut: an inequality that the \ac{MILP} may use to help guide its search but that is not checked when evaluating integer feasibility.
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fixed-exptime-cut-total-time}
    \sum_{j \in J} r_j \leq \frac{\delta - \beta}{\epsilon n_K}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Objective}
\label{sec:fixed-exptime-objective}

Maximize the sum of the probability of all of the pixels that are contained within selected fields:
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fixed-exptime-objective}
    \sum_{i \in I} \rho_i p_i
\end{equation}

\subsection{Problem 2: Variable Exposure Time}
\label{sec:variable-exptime}

In this variation, we have a sky map of the exposure time required to detect the source as a function of its position on the sky. We permit the exposure time to vary for each field. A given pixel counts toward the objective value only if the exposure time of a field that contains that pixel exceeds the pixel's exposure time.

\subsubsection{Problem Setup}
\label{sec:variable-exptime-problem-setup}

\begin{alignat*}{3}
\intertext{\it Additional parameters ---}
    &\text{min exposure time to detect a source in pixel $i$}\quad&
        (\epsilon_i)_{i \in I} \\
    &\text{min allowed exposure time}\quad&
        \epsilon_\mathrm{min} \\
    &\text{max allowed exposure time}\quad&
        \epsilon_\mathrm{max}
\intertext{\it Additional, semicontinuous decision variables ---}
    &\text{exposure time of field $j$}\quad& \\
    &\qquad\left(e_j\right)_{j \in J}, \forall j \in J : e_j = 0 \text{ or } \epsilon_\mathrm{min} \leq e_j \leq \epsilon_\mathrm{max}
\end{alignat*}

\subsubsection{Constraints}

The constraints are slightly different.

\paragraph{Depth}
Only count pixels that are observed to sufficient exposure time.
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:variable-exptime-constraint-depth}
    \forall i \in I :\quad p_\mathrm{i} = 1 \Rightarrow \max_{j \in J_i} e_{j} \geq \epsilon_i
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Exposure time}
If a field's exposure time is nonzero, then it is selected for observation.
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:variable-exptime-constraint-exptime}
    \forall j \in J :\quad \epsilon_\mathrm{max} r_j \geq e_\mathrm{j}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Cadence}
This is similar to Eq.~(\ref{eq:fixed-exptime-constraint-cadence}), except that we replace the right-hand side of the inequality.
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:variable-exptime-constraint-cadence}
    \forall k > 1 ,\; j :\quad t_{jk} - t_{j,k-1} \geq \gamma r_j + e_j
\end{equation}

\paragraph{No overlap}
This is also similar to Eq.~(\ref{eq:fixed-exptime-constraint-no-overlap}), except with a slightly different right-hand side.
%
\begin{multline}
    \label{eq:variable-exptime-constraint-no-overlap}
    \forall j^\prime > j ,\; k ,\; k^\prime : \\ \left|t_{jk} - t_{j^\prime k^\prime}\right|  \geq \sigma_{jj^\prime} \left( r_j + r_{j^\prime} - 1\right) + (e_j + e_\mathrm{j^\prime}) / 2
\end{multline}

\paragraph{\ac{FoR}}
This is similar to Eqs.~(\ref{eq:fixed-exptime-constraint-for-one},~\ref{eq:fixed-exptime-constraint-for-many}), except that we replace $\epsilon$ with $e_j$. For fields that have one observable segment:
%
\begin{multline}
    \label{eq:variable-exptime-constraint-for-one}
    \forall j ,\; k \;, m \mid {n_M}_j = 1 : \\ \alpha_{jm} + e_j / 2 \leq t_{jk} \leq \omega_{jm} - e_j / 2
\end{multline}
%
For fields that have more than one observable segment:
%
\begin{alignat}{2}
    \label{eq:variable-exptime-constraint-for-many}
    \forall j ,\; &k \;, m \mid {n_M}_j > 1 : \nonumber \\
    &s_{jkm} = 1 \;\Rightarrow\; \alpha_{jm} + e_j / 2 \leq t_{jk} \leq \omega_{jm} - e_j / 2 \\
    &\sum_m s_{jkm} \geq 1
\end{alignat}

\subsubsection{Cuts}

\paragraph{Total exposure time}
Replace Eq.~(\ref{eq:fixed-exptime-cut-total-time}) with:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eq:variable-exptime-cut-total-time}
    \sum_{j \in J} r_j &\leq& \frac{\delta - \beta}{\epsilon_\mathrm{min} n_K} \\
    \sum_{j \in J} e_j &\leq& \frac{\delta - \beta}{n_K}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{Objective}

Same as in Section~\ref{sec:fixed-exptime-objective} above.

\subsection{Problem 3: Variable Exposure Time with Prior Distribution of Absolute Magnitude}
\label{sec:absmag-distn}

In this variation, we don't know the precise absolute magnitude $X$ of the source. In the case of \acp{KN}, our prior knowledge about the absolute magnitude is scant; for the sake of mathematical convenience, we assume that the absolute magnitude has a normal distribution, $X \sim~ \mathcal{N}[\mu_X, \sigma_X]$. We need to compute the distribution of \textit{apparent} magnitudes $x$ in order to determine the probability of detection as a function of exposure time for each pixel.

Gravitational-wave sky maps provide the posterior distribution of distance, as a parametric ansatz distribution \citep{2016ApJ...829L..15S,2016ApJS..226...10S},
%
$$
    p(r) = \frac{N}{\sqrt{2 \pi}\sigma} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{r - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2\right] r^2,
$$
%
with the location parameter $\mu$, scale parameter $\sigma$, and normalization $N$ tabulated for each pixel. This is an inconvenient distribution for integration, so instead we construct a log-normal distance distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as the ansatz distribution.

We calculate the mean $m$ and standard deviation $s$ from $\mu$ and $\sigma$ using the function \texttt{parameters\_to\_moments} from \texttt{ligo.skymap}\footnote{\url{https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/ligo.skymap/distance/}}. Then, the location and scale parameters of the log-normal distribution are given by
%
\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eq:log-distance-parameters}
    \mu_{\ln r} &=& \ln m - \frac{1}{2} \ln \left(1 + \frac{s^2}{m^2}\right) \\
    {\sigma_{\ln r}}^2 &=& \ln \left(1 + \frac{s^2}{m^2}\right).
\end{eqnarray}

The logarithm of the distance then has the distribution $\ln r \sim \mathcal{N}[\mu_{\ln r}, \sigma_{\ln r}]$. The apparent magnitude is related to the absolute magnitude through $x = X + 5 \log_{10} r + 25$, assuming that $r$ is in the units of Mpc. Therefore the apparent magnitude has the distribution $x \sim \mathcal{N}[\mu_x, \sigma_x]$, with
%
\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eq:appmag-parameters}
    \mu_x &=& \mu_X + \left(\frac{5}{\ln 10}\right) \mu_{\ln r} + 25 \\
    {\sigma_x}^2 &=& {\sigma_{X}}^2 + \left(\frac{5}{\ln 10}\right)^2 {\sigma_{\ln r}}^2.
\end{eqnarray}

With this Gaussian distribution of apparent magnitudes, we can now calculate the detection efficiency for each pixel: the probability that we detect the source assuming that the source is in that pixel, as a function of exposure time. For the purpose of implementation of this function in a MILP, we approximate it with a piecewise linear function, as illustrated in Fig~\ref{fig:piecewise-linear-exptime}.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/piecewise-linear-exptime}
    \caption{\label{fig:piecewise-linear-exptime}Piecewise linear approximation of the detection efficiency for a given pixel. In this example, we have assumed that the exposure time is inversely proportional to the square root of the flux, valid for sky background dominated imaging.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Additional Data Preparation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use the function \texttt{parameters\_to\_moments} and Eqs.~(\ref{eq:log-distance-parameters},~\ref{eq:appmag-parameters}) to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the apparent magnitude in each pixel.
    \item Select the desired quantiles for the piecewise linear approximation of the detection efficiency curve: for example, $(0, 0.05 , 0.275, 0.5  , 0.725, 0.95)$. For each pixel, calculate the exposure time required to achieve the specified detection efficiency.
\end{enumerate}

$$

\subsubsection{Objective}

\section{Exposure Time Estimation}

The reference \ac{UVEX} \ac{ETC} is still closed source because the instrument is still evolving in small details. We use \ac{M4OPT}'s open-source toy model of the instrument performance that roughly reproduces the public sensitivity curve plot\footnote{\url{https://www.uvex.caltech.edu/page/for-astronomers}; accessed 2025-01-26} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:etc}). The parameters of the toy model are listed in Table~\ref{tab:etc}.

\end{figure}

We need to perform about 1~million \ac{ETC} calculations at different sky positions and apparent magnitudes for each event. The \texttt{synphot} Python package \citep{2018ascl.soft11001S} is the standard tool for synthetic photometry. Unfortunately, it would be prohibitively time-consuming to set up and evaluate 1~million \texttt{synphot} scenarios due to the overhead of creating all of the Python objects involved. Our \texttt{m4opt.synphot} module accelerates synethic photometry calculations by using the symbolic algebra package \texttt{sympy} \citep{10.7717/peerj-cs.103} to rearrange the \texttt{synphot} model tree into additive components with separable spatial dependence that can be integrated separately and then added back together. For nonlinear components (i.e., extinction), we do a parameter sweep and employ interpolation. The result is many orders of magnitude faster than \texttt{synphot} and contributes only about a second of run time to the scheduler.

There are three spatially-dependent spectral components in the \ac{ETC}:

\paragraph{Zodiacal light}
We modeled zodiacal background light by taking the ``high'' sky background spectrum from Hubble \ac{STIS} Instrument Handbook \citep{2024stis.rept....5R} and scaling it by a spatially-dependent factor resulting from bilinear interpolation of from the tables of \citet{1998A&AS..127....1L}. In the future, we plan to replace the spatial dependence with \texttt{zodipy} \citep{2022A&A...666A.107S,2024JOSS....9.6648S}, which has a higher spatial resolution and is valid for locations in throughout the Solar System beyond Earth orbit.

\paragraph{Galactic diffuse background}
\citet{2014ApJS..213...32M} provides piecewise cosecant fits to the surface brightness of Galactic diffuse emission in the two GALEX bands. We employ these fits to get the spatial dependence, and obtain the wavelength dependence by interpolation and extrapolating linearly through the two bands.

\paragraph{Dust extinction}
To model extinction due to dust in the Milky Way, we use the \citet{2023ApJ...950...86G} model as implemented in the \texttt{dust\_extinction} Python package \citep{2024JOSS....9.7023G}. We employ a fixed total-to-selective extinction ratio $R(V) = 3.1$ and obtain $E(B-V)$ reddening values as a function of sky position using the \citet{2016A&A...596A.109P} model as implemented by the \texttt{dustmaps} Python package \citep{2018JOSS....3..695M}.

\section{Case study: GW observations with UVEX}

Here we explain the setup of \ac{M4OPT} for \ac{UVEX}.

\paragraph{\Ac{GW} localizations}
We started with the same simulated \ac{GW} localizations as \citet{2025arXiv250114109C}, which covers LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA's fifth~(O5) and sixth~(O6) observing runs. The data are publicly archived in \cite{r_weizmann_2025_14585837}. These simulated events were generated using the same methodology as \citet{2022ApJ...924...54P} and \citet{2023ApJ...958..158K}, except that the \ac{S/N} threshold for \ac{GW} detection is set to~10. The localizations were generated with the rapid localization engine BAYESTAR \citep{2016PhRvD..93b4013S} and consist of 3D posterior probability distributions of sky location and luminosity distance \citep{2016ApJ...829L..15S,2016ApJS..226...10S}. Like \citet{2025arXiv250114109C} selected only those events for which the rest frame secondary (lighter) compact object mass $m_2$ was $\leq 3 M_\odot$ to pick only events that could plausibly be \ac{BNS} or \ac{NSBH} binaries.

\paragraph{\Ac{KN} absolute magnitude}
Appendix~E.2 of \citet{2021arXiv211115608K} specifies fiducial parameter ranges for nucleosynthesis-powered or shock-powered \ac{KN} models and 90\% credible intervals for the absolute magnitude in each band. These absolute magnitude ranges are reproduced in the Table~\ref{tab:kn-abs-mag}. \ac{UVEX} observes in both the \ac{NUV} and \ac{FUV} filters simultaneously. A detection in both bands is not necessary because even a detection in a single band provides constraining limits on \ac{UV} colors. In order to achieve a detection in at least one filter, regardless of the model, we should plan obsevations using the fainter of the two models and the brighter of the two bands: the nucleosynthesis-powered model in NUV, with an absolute magnitude range of $[-15.6, -12.4]$. Assuming that this is the 90\% credible interval of a Gaussian distribution, the absolute magnitude has the approximate distribution
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:absmag-distn}
    M_\mathrm{NUV} \sim \mathcal{N}(-14, 1).
\end{equation}

\begin{deluxetable}{lcc}
    \tablecaption{\label{tab:kn-abs-mag}Ranges of peak absolute magnitudes of \acp{KN}. Adapted from Appendix E.2 of \citet{2021arXiv211115608K}.}

    Shock powered & [-14.5, -10.2] & [-17.9, -15.0]
    \enddata
\end{deluxetable}

\paragraph{Follow-up time window}
\citet{2025arXiv250114109C} required a single epoch of \ac{UVEX} observations to take 3~hours or less. To match this choice, we configure \ac{M4OPT} to plan two visits of each field with a minimum cadence of 30~min between repeated visits, with a total elapsed time limit of 6~hours. 

\paragraph{Exposure time limits}
The exposure time is allowed to vary adaptively for each field, with a minimum exposure time of $\epsilon_\mathrm{min} = 300$~s. The minimum exposure time corresponds to a single standard \ac{UVEX} imaging exposure. (A standard survey dwell consists of 3 consecutive stacked 300~s exposures.)

\paragraph{FOV}
Like most space telescopes, \ac{UVEX} has solar panels that rotate on a \ac{SADA} perpendicular to the telescope boresight (see Fig.~\ref{fig:render}). The position angle of observations is fixed to the nominal roll angle that allows the spacecraft to orient the solar panels perpendicular to the Sun while keeping the cold side of the spacecraft facing away from the Sun. For any given position, the roll angle goes through one revolution per year. For targets at the ecliptic poles, the nominal roll angle varies linearly with time. For targets in the ecliptic plane, the nominal roll angle flips by 180° at the solstices. At all intermediate ecliptic latitudes, the roll angle oscillates smoothly in a manner that interpolates between these extremes (see Fig.~\ref{fig:nominal-roll}). Because the roll angle changes slowly on the timescale of a day, we calculate the nominal roll angle for each field at the time of the event, and leave it fixed at that value for the duration of the observing plan.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/nominal-roll}
    \caption{\label{fig:nominal-roll}Nominal roll angle as a function of time for selected ecliptic latitudes.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Slew time}
The optimal ``bang-bang'' slew trajectory between any two points consists of an acceleration phase at the maximum acceleration, possibly a coasting phase at the maximum angular velocity, a deceleration phase at the maximum acceleration, and settling (see Fig.~\ref{fig:slew}). We employ a simplified slew model in which the spacecraft has a fixed maximum angular acceleration of $\alpha=0 \fdg 006$~s$^{-2}$, maximum angular rate of $0 \fdg 6$~s$^{-1}$, and settling time of 60~s, irrispective of axis. With these parameters, it takes 108~s to slew by the width of the \ac{FOV} and 460~s to slew by 180$^\circ$.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/slew}
    \caption{\label{fig:slew}The optimal slew consists of an acceleration phase at the maximum acceleration, possibly a coasting phase at the maximum angular velocity, and a deceleration phase at the maximum acceleration.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{\ac{HEALPix} resolution}
We discretize the footprint of the \ac{FOV} on a \ac{HEALPix} grid with $n_\mathrm{side} = 128$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:fov}.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/fov}
    \caption{\label{fig:fov}The footprint of the \ac{UVEX} \ac{FOV} discretized on a \ac{HEALPix} grid with $n_\mathrm{side} = 128$.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Field grid}
The centers of the fields are the vertices of a $\{3,5+\}_{21,4}$ icosahedral geodesic polyhedron (see Fig.~\ref{fig:skygrid}) generated using the \texttt{antiprism} software by Adrian Rossiter\footnote{\url{https://github.com/antiprism/antiprism}}. This grid ensures that all of the fields cover the sky without gaps, regardless of roll angle.

\begin{figure}

        \plotone{figures/skygrid}
    \end{interactive}
    \caption{\label{fig:skygrid}Footprints of the \ac{UVEX} \ac{FOV} on the geodesic reference grid. This figure is available as an animation that shows the variation in position angle of each field with time.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Run duration}
As in \citet{2025arXiv250114109C}, we assumed 1.5~years of overlap between the \ac{UVEX} prime mission and the \ac{GW} observing run.

\paragraph{Follow-up selection criterion}
We ran \ac{M4OPT} on all simulated events. We considered an event selected for follow-up if the scheduler's objective values $P$ was less than $P^* = 0.1$. Recall from Section~\ref{sec:absmag-distn} that the scheduler's objective value is (a numerical approximation of) the probability of detection---integrated over the absolute magnitude, sky position, and distance, none of which are known to the scheduler. We stress that our strategy for selecting which events to trigger is to simply run the scheduler for every single event and proceed if the predicted detection probability is at least 10\%.

This is conceptually very different from the selection criteria in \citet{2025arXiv250114109C} which is based on the 90\% credible area, $A_\mathrm{90\%}$, and luminosity distance $d_\mathrm{L}$ of the event. However, we can predict analytical thresholds on both of these quantities that will be roughly equivalent to our strategy:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
    d_\mathrm{L} &<& d_\mathrm{L}^* = 10^{\frac{1}{5}(x^* - \mu_X + \sigma_X \Phi^{-1}(1-P^*) - 25)}\,\mathrm{Mpc} \label{eq:threshold-distance} \\
    A_Q &<& A_Q^* = \left(\frac{\Psi^{-1}(Q)}{\Psi^{-1}(P^*)}\right)^2 \left(\frac{\delta - \beta}{\epsilon_\mathrm{min} n_K}\right)A_\mathrm{FOV} \label{eq:threshold-area} \\
    \frac{A_Q}{A_\mathrm{FOV}} &<& \left(\frac{d_\mathrm{L}}{d_\mathrm{L}^*}\right)^{-4} \label{eq:threshold-area-distance}

$A_Q$ is the $Q$th percentile credible region, $x^*$ is the faintest limiting magnitude at any point on the sky, $A_\mathrm{FOV}$ is the area of the \ac{FOV}, $\Phi(x)$ is the inverse of the \ac{CDF} of the standard normal distribution, and $\Psi^{-1}(x) = -2\ln(1 - x)$ is the inverse of the \ac{CDF} of a $\chi^2$ distribution with 2 degrees of freedom.

\subsection{Results}

All simulated events are listed in the online version of Table~\ref{tab:events}. Because these are simulated events, we can determine the probability of detection for each event given its true sky location and distance. To calculate the detection probability, we calculate the limiting absolute magnitude for the deepest exposure in the observing plan at that position and distance (or an exposure time of zero if the true sky position is not contained in any planned observation). The detection probability is simply the \ac{CDF} of the absolute magnitude distribution, Eq.~(\ref{eq:absmag-distn}), evaluated at that limiting absolute magnitude.

In Figs.~\ref{fig:area-distance-O5}~and~\ref{fig:area-distance-O6}, we show both the scheduler objective value and the detection probability and as a scatter plot of the 90\% credible area and the luminosity distance of events. As we would expect, both the objective value and detection probability increase as the area and distance of the events decrease.

In Table~\ref{tab:selected-detected}, we list the expected numbers of events selected for follow-up and the number of \acp{KN} detected over 1.5 years of observation. The number of events selected is simply the number of observing plans with objective value $\geq 0.1$. The expected number of \acp{KN} detected is simply the sum of the detection probabilities of all of the events.

As in \citet{2022ApJ...924...54P} and in \citet{2023ApJ...958..158K}, this table gives central 90\% credible intervals about the median, incorporating a lognormal uncertainty in the \ac{BNS} merger rate of $210_{-120}^{240}$~Gpc$^{-3}$~yr$^{-1}$ and Poissonian variation in the number of events over a finite time duration.

\section{Conclusion}

Unfortunately, direct comparisons of the rates in Table~\ref{tab:selected-detected} to \citet{2025arXiv250114109C}, which used \texttt{dorado-scheduling} and a fixed exposure time for each event, are not meaningful because we made many refinements to the starting assumptions. The following changes would lead to a higher detection rate:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item We used a brighter distribution of absolute magnitudes that is consistent with the stated \ac{KN} model ranges in \citet{2021arXiv211115608K}.
    \item We used the more sensitive of the two \ac{UVEX} imaging bands (\ac{NUV}) because we only require a detection in one band.
\end{itemize}
%
The following changes would lead to a lower detection rate:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item We used a much denser and more heavily overlapping grid of fields in order to ensure complete coverage of the sky at all roll angles.
\end{itemize}
%
Our trigger and detection rates in Table~\ref{tab:selected-detected} are considerably greater than the most optimistic estimates in \citet{2025arXiv250114109C}. Although by itself this comparison is not informative on the merits of these two strategies, it is a positive result for the prospects of \ac{KN} detection with \ac{UVEX}.

More quantitatively, we can show that the dynamic exposure time strategy results in a higher detection probability than any given fixed exposure time for a given event. Fig.~\ref{fig:prob-exptime} shows a typical example. This is a plot of detection probability (without knowledge of the position of the source) versus exposure time for observing plans for a single event generated using the formulation from Section~\ref{sec:fixed-exptime}. The detection probability for the dynamic exposure time strategy from Section~\ref{sec:absmag-distn} is shown as a horizontal dashed line.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/prob-exptime}
    \caption{\label{fig:prob-exptime}Detection probability versus exposure time for a single example event, resulting from the fixed exposure time strategy (see Section~\ref{sec:fixed-exptime}). The horizontal dashed line shows the detection probability resulting from the variable exposure time strategy incorporating a distribution of absolute magnitudes (see Section~\ref{sec:absmag-distn}). The variable exposure time strategy is more likely to detect the counterpart than the fixed exposure time strategy, for any exposure time.}
\end{figure}

This novel dynamic exposure time observing strategy is promising for \ac{GW} follow-up with any large \ac{FOV} imaging instrument. Although we have focused on \ac{UVEX}, we encourage ULTRASAT to try it out using the preliminary support for that mission that we have added.

The \ac{M4OPT} model itself is not specific to space-based observations. With additional \ac{FoR} and foreground models it could be extended to ground-based telescopes or even heterogeneous combinations of ground and space telescopes. In the future, we plan to extend it to \ac{ZTF}, Vera Rubin Observatory, and other ground-based facilities. Ultimately, our vision is for \ac{M4OPT} to evolve into a scheduling toolkit featuring (1) a composable library of observing constraints inspired by the interface of the \texttt{astroplan} package \citep{2018AJ....155..128M}, (2) uniform support for observers on the ground and in space, and (3) a globally optimizing scheduler.

Our probabilistic approach to scheduling and triggering follow-up observations can in principle allow for a more detailed treatment of the selection effects incurred during \ac{GW} follow-up campaigns and astrophysical inference from the population of \acp{KN} observed by missions like \ac{UVEX}. Developing a framework for \ac{KN} inference with \ac{UVEX} observations triggered by this method is an exciting direction of future work.

Some practical implementation details remain as future work to incorporate \ac{M4OPT} into the operations of a real observatory. For example:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Our slew time constraints must conservatively model the dynamics of the actual spacecraft, including differing angular rates about different axes and keep-out constraints that must hold through the entire slew trajectory.
\item We must be able to retrieve the spacecraft ephemeris from a live data source rather than evaluating it from a predefined orbital model.
\item We must incorporate pre-defined segments of observing dead time for housekeeping events such as pre-planned ground contacts and momentum dumping maneuvers.
\end{itemize}

Like the \ac{ZTF} scheduler \citep{2019PASP..131f8003B} and the Vera Rubin Observatory scheduler \citep{2019AJ....157..151N}, we see \ac{M4OPT} as both a core component of the ground software system that enables fully autonomous observation planning and execution, and also an approachable and well-documented part of the guest observer science tools for a mission. Its permissive open-source licensing and open development model, free from the encumbrances of \ac{NOSA}, are essential to those goals.

We hope to build from it a community tool that serves many missions from the concept phase all the way through operations. Also, integration of \ac{M4OPT} with community follow-up platforms such as the Gravitational Wave Treasure Map \citep{2020ApJ...894..127W} could open possibilities for more effective and more meaningfully coordinated follow-up observations by multiple independently-operated facilities.
